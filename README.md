Erudite is a Content Recommendation Engine built using Hadoop and MapReduce. 
Erudite means to possess great knowledge or learning, which I believe is exactly what this program does.
By using Collaborative filtering at its heart, Erudite is able to effectively convert bulk of input data into a meaningful graph of relations among the contents which can then be queried to generate recommendations for anything from Movies to songs to products in an ecommerce shopping website.
